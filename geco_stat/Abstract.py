class Factory(object):
    """
    A factory class for mapping the names of AbstractDictRepresentable subclass
    names to their corresponding subclasses. Classes can be added to the
    factory using the ``add_class`` method and recovered using the
    ``get_class`` method, which is useful for, e.g., reconstructing an object
    from a dictionary when the class of that object is specified as a string.

    For example, if ``d`` is such a dictionary, then

        cls = geco_stat.Factory.get_class(d['class'])

    can be used to get (what is presumably) the original class associated with
    the instance represented by that dictionary. The rest of the data in that
    dictionary should then be sufficient (along with the class itself) to
    reconstruct the original object. At the time of writing, this is the
    approach favored by the ``__from_dict__`` private methods used by
    ``from_dict``.

    You can store classes in the factory for later recovery, but you have to
    manually add classes to the factory after defining them. This approach has
    the advantage of facilitating runtime modifications for prototyping or
    advanced munging/scripting purposes; simply defining a new class and
    adding it to the factory should be enough to give it all of the features of
    built-in geco_stat classes.
