## Purpose

`geco_stat` can be used to easily generate histograms, statistics, and
anomaly reports for timing signals generated by LIGO interferometers. It is
meant to simplify the handling of massive amounts of diagnostic data by
providing a simple, organized interface to relevant statistics, easy
progress tracking for large jobs, effortless data visualization, and convenient
ways to combine reports, so that very long timeseries can be efficiently
analyzed in parallel and then recombined into single, monolithic reports
covering entire eras.

## Getting Started

If you just want to use the latest stable version, you can install it with `pip`:

```bash
pip install geco_stat
```

If you are on an environment without root privileges, you can do this by
creating a virtual environment using `virtualenv` in the folder where you
would like to work:

```bash
cd /path/to/working_directory
virtualenv env

# use the virtualenv version of python and pip
source env/bin/activate
pip install geco_stat
```

When finished with your virtual environment, you can exit it by simply running
`deactivate`.

To use the module from this repository for development, run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:stefco/geco_stat.git
```

There is a Makefile included for automating most tasks. To get started, run
`make env`, which will configure a virtual environment for development.

You can simply type `make` to see a list of targets for `make` (i.e. commands you
can have `make` execute).

# To Do

- [ ] Figure out if AbstractReportData should store time information.
